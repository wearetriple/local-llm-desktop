# Local LLM Desktop

A desktop application that wraps the Ollama API and offers a secure, privacy-friendly local chat interface.
Built with Electron and React, this application allows you to interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs)
directly on your machine without sending data to external servers.

## Features

- ü§ñ Local LLM Integration with Ollama
- üîí Privacy-focused - all data stays on your machine
- üîç Use local files as additional input
- üßç Personas for different characters and behavior for the conversation
- üí¨ Modern chat interface
- üì± Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS)

## Getting Started

Download and install the application from the [releases page](https://github.com/wearetriple/local-llm-desktop/releases) page.
Pick the correct file for your system.

The application is currently not digitally signed, so you will receive security warnings when installing:

- On Windows: You'll see a "Windows protected your PC" message. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed with installation.
- On macOS: You'll get a message that the app "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified". To bypass this, right-click (or Control-click) the app in Finder and select "Open". Click "Open" in the dialog that appears.
